Supercomputing Applications. The terms "you" and "your" shall mean the person or
entity identified below. If this contribution is on behalf of a company, the
terms "you" and "your" will also mean the company you identify below. If you
agree to be bound by these terms, fill in the information requested below and
provide your signature. Read this agreement carefully before signing. These
terms and conditions constitute a binding legal agreement.

1.  The term "contribution" or "contributed materials" means any source code,
    object code, patch, tool, sample, graphic, specification, manual,
    documentation, or any other material posted or submitted by you to the
    project.

2.  With respect to any worldwide copyrights, or copyright applications and
    registrations, in your contribution:

    * you hereby assign to us joint ownership, and to the extent that such
      assignment is or becomes invalid, ineffective or unenforceable, you hereby
      grant to us a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge,
      royalty-free, unrestricted license to exercise, at our sole discretion,
      all rights under those copyrights. This includes, at our option, the right
      to sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels
      of sublicensees or other licensing arrangements;

    * you agree that each of us can do all things in relation to your
      contribution as if each of us were the sole owners, and if one of us makes
      a derivative work of your contribution, the one who makes the derivative
      work (or has it made) will be the sole owner of that derivative work;

    * you agree that you will not assert any moral rights in your contribution
      against us, our licensees or transferees;

    * you agree that we may register a copyright in your contribution and
      exercise all ownership rights associated with it; and
    
    * you agree that neither of us has any duty to consult with, obtain the
      consent of, pay, or render an accounting to the other for any use or
      distribution of your contribution.

3.  With respect to any patents you own, or that you can license without payment
    to any third party, you hereby grant to us a perpetual, irrevocable,
    non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free license to, at our sole
    discretion:

    * make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer
      your contribution in whole or in part, alone or in combination with or
      included in any product, work or materials arising out of the project to
      which your contribution was submitted; and

    * sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of
      sublicensees or other licensing arrangements.

4.  Except as set out above, you keep all right, title, and interest in your
    contribution. The rights that you grant to us under these terms are
    effective on the date you first submitted a contribution to us, even if your
    submission took place before the date you sign these terms. Any contribution
    we make available under any license will also be made available under a
    suitable Free Software/Open Source license (as defined and approved by the
    Free Software Foundation or the Open Source Initiative).

5.  With respect to your contribution:

    * you represent that it is and shall be an original work of authorship and
      that you can legally grant the rights set out in these terms;

    * you warrant that, to the best of your knowledge, it does not and shall not
      violate any third party's copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other
      intellectual property rights;
    
    * you represent that it is and shall be in compliance with U.S. export
      control laws and other applicable export and import laws;

    * you agree to notify us if you become aware of any circumstance which would
      make any of the foregoing representations inaccurate in any respect;

    * you acknowledge that we may include it in whole, or in part, at our sole
      discretion, and that we are under no obligation to accept it in any part;

    * unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, you provide it
      on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either
      express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
      conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a
      particular purpose;

    * you grant us permission to publicly disclose your participation in the
      project, including the fact that you have signed this CLA;

    * and you are authorized to sign this contract on behalf of your company (if
      identified below).
