The ever-growing scope of exterme-scale supercomputers requires an increasing
volume of component-local metrics to better understand their systemic behaviour.
The collection and analysis of these metrics have become data-intensive tasks in
their own right, the products of which inform system support activities critical
to ongoing operations.  With recent emphasis being placed on topology-awareness
as a step towards better coping with extreme scale, the ability to visualize
complex topology data has become increasingly valuable.  We present TorusVis, a
general-purpose visualization tool applicable to a wide variety of
topology-related data presentation scencarios.  Its general-purpose software
architecture lends itself well to rapid prototyping of various data presentation
concepts as well as publishing fully featured visualizations.  We describe
several key design elements and implementation strategies, as well as several
use case studies where the capabilities available in TorusVis aided
understanding of system behaviour in ways not possible, otherwise.
